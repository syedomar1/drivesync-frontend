# Getting Started with Vehicle-Driver Mapping System

## Introduction

The Vehicle-Driver Mapping System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the management of vehicle and driver assignments. Whether you manage a fleet of vehicles or oversee driver logistics, this system provides an efficient way to assign drivers to vehicles, schedule assignments, and handle potential conflicts. Leveraging modern web technologies, the system ensures smooth operations by optimizing driver availability, location-based assignments, and time-bound scheduling. This README file provides a detailed guide to using the Vehicle-Driver Mapping System, outlining its features, functionalities, and how to get started.

## Key Features

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Driver Creation**                | Create and store driver profiles with essential attributes such as name, email, phone number, and location. Drivers can be searched by name or phone.               |
| **Vehicle-Driver Assignment**      | Assign drivers to vehicles manually, with the ability to unassign them when necessary. The system ensures a driver is assigned to only one vehicle at a time.        |
| **Time Scheduling**                | Implement time-bound assignments, ensuring no overlapping assignments for a driver. This prevents conflicts in scheduling and optimizes resource usage.              |
| **Assignment Requests**            | Allow drivers to receive and respond to assignment requests. Drivers can accept or reject requests, with only one driver able to accept a request at a time.         |
| **Location-Based Assignment**      | Search for available drivers based on proximity to a specified location. The system considers driver availability, location, and scheduling conflicts for assignments. |
| **Search algorithm for Vehicles and Drivers**         | Uses latest metrics to filter dynamically in real time.                                                         |
